Sometimes  the  question of children and  how  they factor  into  extreme  early retirement  comes  up.
有时会出现孩子的问题，以及他们在极端提前退休的影响。
We  don't  have  children,  so  what  follows  are  my  purely theoretical thoughts on raising a child and how it would impact early retirement, and the child.
我们没有孩子，所以下面是我关于抚养孩子的纯理论思考，以及这将如何影响提前退休和孩子。

Most  importantly,  it  should  be  realized  that  children  don't  spend  a  lot  of money; rather, their parents do! This means that raising a child costs as much as you can afford.
最重要的是，应该意识到孩子们不会花很多钱；花钱的是他们的父母！这意味着抚养一个孩子要量力而行。
It is certainly possible to clothe and feed a child for $100/month just like it is possible to clothe and feed an adult for that amount.
当然，每个月花100美元给孩子吃穿是有可能的，就像用这么多钱给成年人吃穿一样。
Beyond this, all they need is love, learning, activity, and responsibilities.
除此之外，他们所需要的是爱护、学习、活动和责任。
You can either pay for someone else to provide this or you can provide it yourself.
你可以花钱请别人提供这些，也可以自己提供。
Most arguments will originate in the belief that it is normal, needed, or even desirable to pay someone else to provide these services.
大多数争论都源于这样一种信念：付钱给别人提供这些服务是正常的、必要的，甚至是可取的。

I believe that having a stay-at-home parent  is  a  very  good  idea, and  I  don't think I'd want it otherwise.
我相信有一个居家父母是一个非常好的主意。
I had a stay-at-home parent myself.
我自己也有个居家父母。
My mom stayed home  full-time  for  the  first  six  years  of  my  life  and  after  we  started  going  to school she took a part-time job, so we never came home to an empty house.
我妈妈在我六岁前全职呆在家里，在我们开始上学后，她做了一份兼职工作，所以我们回家时从来不是空房子。
This naturally  goes  very  well  with  the  idea  of  early  retirement.
这自然与提前退休的想法非常吻合。
Not  only  does financial  independence  and  early  retirement  automatically  allow  for  someone who stays at home; it doesn't delay the working spouse from early retirement in the sense that they don't have to provide for two people, since the retired adult is already providing investment income.
经济独立和提前退休自动允许有人留在家里；这不会延迟工作配偶退休，因为他们不必供养两个人，退休的成年人已经在投资获得收入。
This is also a good argument for achieving financial independence before having children--it only takes five years! 
这也是在有孩子之前实现经济独立的一个很好的理由——只需要五年！

I wouldn't send my children off to cello lessons, travel soccer, or preschool where  they  could  pretend  to  be  intellectually  stimulated  at  a  rate  of $1,500/month  by  learning  a  few  words  of  Mandarin.
我不会送我的孩子去上大提琴课、旅游足球或幼儿园学前班，在那里，每月花1500美元，学习几句普通话来假装受到了智力激励。
I  suspect  children  cost exactly as much as you're capable of spending.
我怀疑孩子的花费能和你花的一样多。
You can buy their clothes at thrift stores, just like you buy your own, or you can buy designer outfits for them just as  you  buy  designer  outfits  for  yourself.
你可以在旧货店买他们的衣服，就像你自己买一样，或者你可以为他们买设计师服装，就像你为自己买设计师服装一样。
Their  entertainment  can  match  your own.
他们的娱乐可以和你的相匹配。
I don't believe in the necessity of everybody having their own room.
我不相信每个人都要有自己房间的必要性。
Again, this comes down to social skills.
这又一次归结为社交技能。
Sharing used to be normal; ask your parents or grandparents.
分享曾经很正常；问问你的父母或祖父母。
There are certainly happy families on cruising boats where nobody has their own room.
游船上当然也有幸福的家庭，没有人有自己的房间。
It can be done.
这是可以做到的。

Essentially,  love  and  caring  would  be  demonstrated  through  spending  time together  rather  than  spending  money.
从本质上讲，爱和关心将通过花时间在一起而不是花钱来表现。
I  would  make  sure  they  did  their homework.
我会确保他们做了家庭作业。
I would encourage inexpensive and creative hobbies.
我会鼓励廉价和创造性的爱好。
There would be chores in the form of housework since everybody would contribute in their own way.
因为每个人都会以自己的方式做出贡献，所以会有家务活。
I would certainly not try to fill their schedule with leadership activities and other  brouhaha  for  their  application  to  Brand  Name  University.
我当然不会领导喧闹的活动来填满他们的日程，用来申请名牌大学。
I  would  make sure they did their homework, but I would let them make their own mistakes.
我会确保他们做了家庭作业，但我会让他们犯错误。

I don't think I would pay an allowance, but I would hire them to do work not associated with the household.
我不认为我会支付津贴，但我会雇佣他们从事与家庭无关的工作。
Whenever they got a money gift (birthday, Xmas) or  any  income  whatsoever,  I  would  make  them  put  50%  into  savings  and  let them spend the other 50% as they wished.
每当他们收到礼物（生日、圣诞节）或任何收入时，我都会让他们把50%存起来，让他们随心所欲地花掉剩下的50%。
I would let them spend the interest of their savings account, hoping that they got the point.
我会让他们把储蓄存款的利息花掉，希望他们明白这一点。
Once they understood the point of this exercise, the decision would be up to them.
一旦他们明白了这项工作的意义，决定权就在他们自己。
In the end, I would not be  able  to  make  the  decision  of  whether  they  should  be  salary  men,  working men, businessmen, or Renaissance men.
最后，我将无法决定他们应该是薪资人、打工人、生意人还是文艺复兴人。
That would be up to them.
这将取决于他们自己。

Naturally I'd also educate them on life skills that they don't get from school.
当然，我也会教他们从学校得不到的生活技能。
They  would  know  how  to  read  a  balance  sheet,  double  dig  a  garden,  put  up  a shelf,  and  fix  a  flat  before  turning  18.
他们在18岁之前会学会阅读资产负债表、翻修花园、搭建架子和修缮公寓。
Again,  the  decision  whether  to  spend money on this later on would be theirs.
再说一次，是否在这件事上花钱将是他们自己的决定。

Speaking of school, I would concentrate on the early years (primary) rather than  the  late  years  (trade  school  /  college).
说到学校，我会把注意力集中在早年（小学）而不是晚年（商学院）。
Generalized  skills,  such  as  work discipline and the multiplication table, learned early are far more important than a  course  in  Ancient  Egyptian  Algebra,  in  my  opinion.
在我看来，早期学习的一般技能，如劳动纪律和乘法表，远比学习古埃及代数重要得多。
I  would  strongly encourage  that  they  learn  a  trade  (machinist,  engineer,  accountant,  nurse,  etc.) before  going  for  their  education  (English  literature,  history,  political  science, mathematics,  etc.).
我强烈建议他们在接受教育（英国文学、历史、政治学、数学等）之前先学习一门专业（机械师、工程师、会计、护士等）。
This  would  make  it  possible  to  work  their  way  through college and always have something to fall back on.
这将使他们有可能努力读完大学，并且总是有一些可以依靠的东西。
I would probably not pay for a college education, but they would be free to stay at home until they finish.
我可能不会支付大学教育费用，但他们可以自由地呆在家里，直到毕业。
I'd recommend a state university and make them fully aware of the consequences of being in debt up to their eyeballs should they insist on a brand name college.
我会推荐一所州立大学，让他们充分意识到，如果他们坚持要名牌大学的话，负债到他们眼前的后果。

In conclusion, I don't believe that adding members to our household would materially  change  the  possibility,  form,  and  implementation  of  financial independence.
总之，我不认为增加家庭成员会实质性地改变财务独立的可能性、形式和实施。

Voluntarily stepping out of the consumer cycle and saving enough to replace one's  job  with  investment  income  instead  of  working  isn't  "normal."  
自愿走出消费周期，储蓄足够的钱，用投资收入取代工作，而不是工作，这是不“正常的”。
The  great majority of people do neither, and those who do one almost never do the other.
绝大多数人两者都不做，做其中一个的人几乎从不做另一个。
Anyone  not  consuming  as  much  as  possible  tends  to  do  so  out  of  external necessity and thus doesn't have savings to invest.
任何没有尽可能多地消费的人，往往会出于外部需要而这样做，因此没有储蓄可以投资。
Anyone investing for income tends  to  have  plenty  of  money  and  thus  consumes  at  an  average  if  not  above average level.
任何为收入而投资的人往往有很多钱，因此即使不高于平均水平，也会以平均水平消费。
There are few doing both; most do neither.
很少有人两者兼而有之；大多数人都不具备。

To  do  both  requires  navigating  four  types  of  people  (see  this  figure).
具备这两者需要在四种类型的人这导航（参见此[图](..\img\5-fig1.png)）。
As before, the types may overlap each other and should be thought of as archetypes.
和以前一样，这些类型可能相互重叠，应该被视为原型。
The  popular  consumer  culture  represents  the  dominant  type.
大众消费文化代表了主导类型。
Being  surrounded by this culture around the clock makes adopting its values almost unavoidable.
日以继夜地被这种文化所包围，几乎不可避免地接受了它的价值观。
Indeed,  you  may  have  to  deal  with  your  "inner  consumer"  from  time  to  time questioning you.
事实上，你可能不得不经常地与你的“内在消费者”打交道。
This culture measures  success in terms of status symbols like things owned or number of visits to exotic places, awards, job titles, etc.
这种文化以身份象征来衡量成功，比如拥有的东西或去异国他乡的次数、奖项、职称等。
One's value  is  measured  by  salary--a  marketing  executive  is  more  valuable  than  a schoolteacher--or what something costs.
一个人的价值是通过工资来衡量的——市场营销主管比教师更有价值——或者某件东西的成本。
Often, new things are valued more than used things--shrinkwrap in particular significantly increases perceived value.
通常，新的东西比旧的东西更有价值——特别是收缩包装显著增加了感知价值。
But popular opinion is only rational from its own internal perspective; consuming for the sake of consumption.
但大众舆论只有从其自身的内在角度来看才是理性的；为了消费而消费。

By choosing not to strive for these things, those who do will feel judged or be led to question their choices.
如果选择不为这些事情而奋斗，那些这样做的人会觉得受到了评判，或者他们的选择受到了质疑。
This is largely their problem to deal with, but it will  also  turn  into  your  problem,  insofar  as  you  have  to  deal  with  concerned inquiries  about  your  material  comfort  level  or  their  trying  to  rationalize  their choices.
这在很大程度上是他们要处理的问题，但它也会变成你的问题，因为你必须处理有关你的物质舒适度，或他们试图使他们的选择合理化的问题。
As noted above, you may ask yourself questions like, "Can I really be comfortable  with  only  one  bathroom?  Don't  I  deserve  two?"  or,  "If  I  can't identify with a job title, like assistant sales manager, who am I really?" On the other  hand,  it  is  possible  to  find  other  people  pursuing  frugality  or  voluntary simplicity  as  well  as  people  interested  in  investing.
如上所述，你可能会问自己这样的问题：“我真的可以只拥有一间浴室吗？我不应该拥有两间吗？”或者，“如果一个职位不能表示我，比如助理销售经理，我到底是谁？”另一方面，也可能找到其他追求节俭或自愿简单的人，以及对投资感兴趣的人。
If  you  prefer  to  avoid confrontation, keep a low profile when it comes to this area of your life.102 
如果你想避免冲突，那么在生活的这个领域保持低调。
Don't mention that you also happen to manage a six-figure portfolio to your "voluntary simplicity" friends  and  don't  mention  that  you  only  have  one  bedroom  to  your investment friends unless you're prepared for the resulting discussion.
不要提及你也碰巧为你的“自愿简单”朋友管理了一个六位数的投资组合，也不要对你的投资朋友提及你只有一间卧室，除非你准备好进行讨论。

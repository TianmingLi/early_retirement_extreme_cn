All  systems  possess  ecological  knowledge  intuitively  through  evolutionary means. 

 Being  part  of  an  ecological  system,  humans  used  to  possess  this knowledge  as  well. 

 However,  technology  has  created  an  aberrated  bubble, screening  people  from  this  knowledge. 

 Most  people  are  therefore  no  longer capable of thinking in ecological terms. 

Indeed, it has resulted in a new kind of system  which,  like  all  young  systems,  is  more  focused  on  exponential  growth, production,  expansion,  and  quantity  rather  than  stability,  protection, consolidation, and quality, which are the marks of a mature system. 

Unfortunately for the existing mature systems in nature, the rapid expansion of  the  human  bubble  is  destroying  them. 

 Unfortunately  for  us,  we  can't  exist without them any more than a living person can exist without oxygen or a body can exist without a head. 

In this sense, it is actually a conceptual error to define the environment as the rest of the biosphere save humans, and think of ourselves as apart from it, since we can't exist without it. 

Aside  from  the  continued  existence  of  humanity,  ecological  understanding includes many principles about the organization of complex systems which are very  useful  for  living  as  a  Renaissance  man. 

 Ecological  goals  for  someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to know the names of five grasses, five birds, five trees, etc. 

local to your area, and be able to recognize them. 

know  which  food  is  in  season  and  how  much  oil,  water,  and  fertilizer  it takes  to  grow/raise  the  food  (out  of  season,  out  of  location)  and  how  it  is sensitive to Liebig's Law of the minimum. 

grow and sustain a garden without using pesticides, hybrid seeds, chemical- based fertilizer, etc. 

A garden and indeed any system will achieve maximum integrity  when  it  is  in  balance,  and  when  growth  is  stable  and  resilient without ongoing external interference. 

promote functional diversity to retain adaptive capacity, to allow evolution to  happen  when  the  environment  changes. 

 Adaptive  and  evolutionary potential  should  be  considered  before  interfering. 

 Actions  always  have reactions, and so action is not always a good idea. 

always  consider  the  system  and  understand  both  the  parts  and  the  whole. 

No  parts  exist  without  the  whole  and  the  whole  doesn't  exist  without  the parts. 

 Everything  is  related  to  everything  else,  mostly  indirectly. 

 Thus, changing one part will change the whole. 

recognize  multiple  bottom  lines,  flows,  and  balances  in  terms  of  primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers, producers, and decomposers. 

use the maximum power principle (see Appropriate response), which states that systems strive to maximize the rate of useful work--that is, to not waste energy to its environment. 

understand  the  concept  of  characteristic  scales  in  terms  of  change  and  the effect of limits on competition and cooperation. 

Understand  the  difference between  positive  feedbacks  and  negative  feedbacks  (both  are  needed)  and how linking feedbacks lead to cycles, runaways, or overshoots. 

study the structure and principles of different systems to build a collection of models, in order to understand other systems.

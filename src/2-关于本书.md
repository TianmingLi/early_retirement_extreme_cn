I think of this book first and foremost as a philosophy book about strategy.
我认为首先本书是一个关于策略的哲学书籍。
Like most philosophical books, it's voluminous compared to its content because much of it is dedicated to (re)defining underlying concepts and fundamentals,
像许多哲学书籍一样，它使用大量的篇幅重新定义了一些基本概念，
trying to find the words to describe something that isn't automatically implied by the usual understanding1 of the words used. 
尝试找到文字去描述一些平常不会用这些文字自动去描述的东西。
The lack of concrete specifics is intentional  because  they  won't  pertain  to  very  many  people.  
缺少详细的说明是有意的，因为他们不会适合大多数人。
The  approach  is deliberately open-ended to make the concepts applicable to as many different
situations as possible. 
途径是有意的开放式，使概念适用于尽可能多的适应不同情况。
This may also mean that the concepts, which aim to create consilient and resilient structures, are applicable to other kinds of organizing like policy-making or business management.
这也可能意味着旨在创造一些有一致性和弹性结构的概念，使他们适用于其他类型的组织，如
政策制定或商业管理。

This  book  isn't  a  "how-to"  manual  to  a  specific  lifestyle,  but  a  "how-to" manual for "how-to" manuals. The intention is for each person to create his own strategy.   
这本书不是特定生活方式“怎么做”的手册，而是一个“怎么做”手册的“怎么做”手册。
这么做的目的是让每个人都能创造一个属于他自己的方案。
In  this  sense,  this  book  isn't  a  travel  journal,  nor  is  it  a  set  of  map directions;  it's  a  book  that  teaches  you  to  become  a  navigator. 
从这个意义上说，这本书不是一本旅行日记，也不是一套地图指南； 这是一本教你成为领航者的书。
I  used  the principles in this book to reduce my expenses to a quarter of the average person and  become  financially  independent  in  five  years. 
我使用本书中的原则，将我的开支减少到普通人的1/4，并在五年内实现经济独立。
While  my  story  may  be entertaining or inspiring, it may not be directly useful towards reaching a similar goal. 
虽然我的故事可能很有趣或鼓舞人心，但它可能对实现类似的目标没有直接的用处。
Similarly, while initially motivating due to their actionable form, a set of map directions would fail the first time one reaches a crossroads not on the map.
同样，虽然最初由于其可操作性而有激励作用，但在第一次到达并不在地图上的十字路口时就会失败。
This  would  end  the  journey  if  the  "pilot"  has  no navigational  skills. 
如果“飞行员”没有导航技能，这将结束旅程。
I  have therefore written the book as a textbook. 
因此，我把这本书写成了教科书。
Learning how to become financially independent requires study. 
学习如何在经济上独立需要学习和研究。
This requires effort and is not easy--if it was truly easy,  everybody  would  be  doing  it--but  it's  no  more  difficult  than  getting  a college education or becoming a skilled tradesman in your respective field. 
这需要努力，但并不容易——如果真的很容易，每个人都会去做——但这也并不比接受大学教育，或成为各自领域的熟练商人更困难。
What I'll describe here is another kind of life, the life of an independently wealthy and widely skilled person--a modern Renaissance man.
我在这里要描述的是另一种生活，一个独立的、富有的和拥有广泛技能的人的生活——一个现代文艺复兴人。

## A note about the difficulty level
## 关于难度级别的说明

This isn't a book for beginners. 
这不是一本适合初学者的书。

It's not a book one can pick up, read, and proceed  to  become  financially  independent  just  as  reading  a  textbook  about physics  won't  turn  a  person  into  a  physicist. 
这不是一本可以拿起、阅读，按部就班就能实现经济独立的书，就像阅读物理教科书不会将一个人变成物理学家一样。

This  only  happens  when  the concepts are constantly applied and one starts "thinking like a physicist." 
这只有在不断应用这些概念，并且开始“像物理学家一样思考”时才会发生。 


Things are similar for a person pursuing financial independence.
This  is  a  book  which  I  think  can  be  read  at  several  different  levels. 
对于追求经济独立的人来说，情况是相似的。

这是一本我认为可以在几个不同层次上阅读的书。

The reason  for  different  levels  is  that  people  change  as  they  learn. 
不同层次的原因是人们在学习时会发生改变。

Depending  on where  you  are,  the  book  will  relate  to  you  in  different  ways. 
根据你所在的位置，这本书会以不同的方式与你相关联。

This  is  good, because those who evolve will become different people, eventually. 
这很好，因为那些进化的人，最终会变成不同的人。

What used to seem like a sacrifice will seem natural, and what used to seem natural will come to be seen as a sacrifice. 
过去看起来像是牺牲的东西，会看起来很自然，而曾经看起来很自然的东西，将被视为牺牲。

What used to be a collection of techniques will become a general principle. 
过去是技术的集合将成为一个普遍的原则。

What used to feel challenging will now feel easy.
过去感觉具有挑战性的事情现在变得容易了。

## A note about getting started
## 开始前注意事项

You don't need to learn everything before getting started. 
在开始之前，你不需要学习所有东西。

After all, you can drive a car without knowing how the engine works. 
毕竟，不知道发动机工作原理的情况下，你也可以开车。

In fact, you can drive several different kinds of cars. 
事实上，你还可以驾驶多种不同类型的车。

This is because most cars handle the same. 
这是因为，大多数汽车的驾驶方式相同。

However, to stay  with  the  analogy,  the  same  car  can  be  driven  with  very  different  gas mileages. 
然而，保持类比，同一辆车的油耗可以差别很大。

It may be listed as 33mpg, but good technique can double that number and poor technique can cut it in half. 
标称可能是14公里每升，但技术好可以使这个数字翻倍，技术差会将这个数字减半。

A trivial technique is to reduce speed by 5mph, which will simply bring most drivers back to the speed limit. 
一个小技术是将速度降低8公里每小时，也简单地让大多数司机回到限速。

Similarly, if living is thought of as driving a particular kind of "vehicle," there are techniques in this book which can be applied without understanding exactly why they work.
类似地，如果将生活视为驾驶一种特定的“车”，那么本书中的一些技术，可以在不了解其工作原理的情况下使用。

Understanding  why  they  work  will  subsequently  allow  one  to  tweak  and improve them.
而了解它们的工作原理，将允许人们调整和改进它们。

## A note about references
## 关于引用的注释

This is not an academic work. 
这不是学术著作。

I have resisted the temptation to follow the medievally inspired academic tradition of citing old books to make statements based on authority.2 
我抵制了中世纪传统学术的诱惑，即引用旧书依照权威来陈述。

I find that showing the derivation from basic principles is more  useful  for  application. 
我发现，展示基本原理的推导，对应用更有用。

Instead  of  references,  I  have  provided  a bibliography of books in the appendix of this book, each of which will add to the subject.
我在附录中提供了参考书目，而不是参考文献，每本书都会增加到主题中。

## A note about geography
## 关于地理的注释

While this book is somewhat US-centric in its examples, the methods should work in any developed country with a market economy. 
虽然这本书的例子有点以美国为中心，但这些方法应该适用于，任何具有市场经济的发达国家。

Retirement plans have different names from country to country, but every country offers very similar plans to its citizens. 
退休计划在不同国家/地区有不同的名字，但每个国家/地区为其公民提供的方案都非常相似。

In some countries health care is paid through taxes, and in other  countries  it's  paid  out  of  pocket. 
在一些国家，医疗保健是通过税收支付的，而在其他国家，它是自掏腰包支付的。

In  any  case  the  prices  for  goods  and services  are  similar  in  developed  countries  so  the  strategies  in  this  book  will work, even if technical details differ
无论如何，发达国家的商品和服务价格是相似的，因此即使技术细节不同，本书中的策略也能奏效。

## A note about originality
## 关于原创性的说明

Feynman  once  remarked  that  the  best  way  to  find  new  insights  into  a problem was to step out of the box, ignore previous publications, and come to your own conclusions. 
费曼曾经说过，找到问题新见解的最佳方法是跳出框框，忽略以前的出版物，得出自己的结论。

With such an approach, it often happens that a concept which  is  initially  considered  to  be  novel  turns  out  to  have  been  discovered already. 
使用这种方法，最初被认为是新颖的概念，会是已经被发现的。

In  fact,  many  of  the  ideas  in  this  book  go  back  decades  and  even centuries. 
事实上，本书中的许多想法可以追溯到几十年甚至几个世纪前。

To give an example, when I was a teenager, I wasted a lot of my time playing computer games. 
举个例子，当我十几岁的时候，我浪费了很多时间玩电脑游戏。

One genre I particularly enjoyed was real-time strategy: games like Dune, Warcraft I and II, and Command and Conquer. 
我特别喜欢的一种类型是即时战略游戏，像：沙丘、魔兽争霸 I 和 II 以及命令与征服。

In these games you build up forces comprised of individual units (tanks, warriors, etc.). 
在这些游戏中，您可以建立由单个单位（坦克、战士等）组成的部队。

When these units fight, each fights at full strength until it's destroyed or killed. 
当这些单位战斗时，每个单位都会全力战斗，直到被摧毁或杀死。

Since the rate of attrition depends on the number of weapons firing or striking, the optimal strategy in a battle is therefore for all your units to attack a single individual enemy at a time to reduce the number of enemies firing or striking as fast as possible. 
由于损耗率取决于开火或打击的武器数量，因此战斗中的最佳策略是让所有单位一次攻击单个敌人，以尽快减少开火或打击的敌人数量。

A great many players have independently "discovered" this strategy, called Lanchester's Square Law, without being aware that it had actually already been discovered by Frederick W.Lanchester during World War I. 

很多玩家独立“发现”了这个称为Lanchester平方定律的策略，却没有意识到，它实际上已经被Frederick W Lanchester 在二战中发现了。

So it is with many observations about life in general. 
因此，对一般生活的许多观察也是如此。

This incidentally is why reading the classics  is  very  worthwhile--concepts  get  discovered,  forgotten,  and  then rediscovered, either independently or by reading old books. 
顺便说一句，这也是阅读经典非常值得的原因——概念被发现、遗忘，然后重新发现，无论是独立还是通过阅读旧书。

Like Lanchester's Law, I discovered many of the concepts in this book only to find out later that someone else had already discovered and named the concept before me. 
就像Lanchester定律一样，我发现了本书中的许多概念，后来才发现其他人已经在我之前发现并命名了这些概念。

Further reading revealed that yet others had written about the concept before them, and so on.3 Analogously, I'm sure that Lanchester wasn't the first person to think about how to most effectively direct the fire of siege trebuchets
进一步阅读显示，还有其他人在他们之前写过这个概念，等等。 类似地，我相信兰彻斯特不是第一个，思考如何最有效地引导投石机火力的人。

## A note about completeness
## 关于完整性的说明

There's  always  the  temptation  to  make  a  book  complete. 
总是有使一本书完整的诱惑。

However,  a  line must be drawn lest the book grow to the size of a minor encyclopedia. 
但是，必须划出界限，以免这本书增长到一本小百科全书的大小。

After all, the quantity of knowledge that must be mastered is not trivial, and thus I can't describe  everything. 
毕竟，必须掌握的知识量很大，因此我无法描述所有东西。

However,  I  hope  I've  used  enough  relevant  keywords  to allow  a  quick  search  on  the  Internet  for  more  information. 
但是，我希望我已经使用了足够多的关键字，以便可以在 Internet 上搜索获取更多信息。

In  all  cases  I've striven to use standard words rather than jargon.
在所有情况下，我都努力使用标准词汇而不是行话。

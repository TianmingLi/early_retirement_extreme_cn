I'm not a big fan of automatizing personal finances. 

我不是一个自动化个人财务的大粉丝。

In my opinion, the only
thing worse than automatic control is no control. 

在我的观点里，比自动化控制更能糟糕的就是没有控制。

The former is, however, a large
improvement over the latter. 

然而，前者是在后者上做了大幅度的改进。

The most important reason for this is that automatic
procedures eventually fail. 

更重要的原因是，自动化的处理经常会失效。

A missed automatic transfer due to some institution
changing their procedures might result in cascading failure of everything linked
to that account. 

由于一些指令改变，缺失的自动化环节会给关联到账户上面的所有东西带来错误。

When this happens, companies love to slap you with exorbitant
fees.

当这发生时，公司喜欢用高额的费用来教育你。

The systemic problem is forced complexity and tight coupling.

系统性的问题是过度复杂和强耦合。

 You can't get
rid of the forced complexity without giving up automatization.

你不放弃自动化就没法摆脱过度复杂。

 However, you
can decouple by keeping a buffer amount  in  each  account  comparable  to  the
maximum amount you have/will ever withdraw from the account. 

然而，你可以通过保持一个缓冲账户，每个账户放置你会撤出的最大数目，的方式来解耦。

Keeping all
these buffers has opportunity costs, but think of them as a cash reserve that could
be used elsewhere, if you cancel all the automatic systems.

保持这些缓冲会有一定花费，如果你取消了所有的自动化系统，可以把它们当作用到其它方面的预备现金。

Statistically,  cycling  is  about  as  dangerous as  driving  a standard-sized  car-- SUVs  are  a  little  bit  more  dangerous  because  of  rollovers  and  the  increased difficulty of swerving out of the way in a bigger vehicle.97 
从统计数据来看，骑自行车和开标准尺寸的汽车一样危险——SUV更危险一些，因为翻车和在更大的车辆上转弯的难度增加。
However, many bike riders are killed because they ride in the wrong direction or on the sidewalk. 
然而，许多骑自行车的人因为骑错方向或在人行道上死的。
A particularly  lethal  combination  is  riding  the  wrong  way  on  the  sidewalk;  a turning  car  will  never  suspect  you're  coming. 
一个特别致命的组合是在人行道上走错方向；转弯的汽车永远不会想到你骑过来了。
Avoiding  these  bad  habits,  most likely learned while riding around on trikes in suburbia as a child, will make you safer riding a bike than driving a car. 
避免这些坏习惯，这很可能是小时候在郊区骑三轮车时学会的，这会让你骑自行车比开车更安全。

On top of that, you must ride defensively; just presume that the other drivers are out to kill you because they don't know any better. 
最重要的是，你必须防守式骑行；就假设有司机想撞你，因为他们不知道怎么更好地开车。
A five foot tall teenager in her  dad's  supertruck  literally  might  not  know  any  better  because  she  can't  see you over the side window. 
一个1米5的少年坐在她爸爸的超级卡车里，可能真的不知道，因为她从侧窗看不到你。
Try to get eye contact with other drivers. 
尽量与其他司机进行眼神交流。
They will mainly  be  looking  for  other  cars;  if  you  have  not  established  eye  contact,  you can "safely" presume that they have not seen you and that they will go right out in front of you. 
他们将主要寻找其他汽车；如果你没有建立眼神交流，你可以“安全地”假设他们没有看到你，他们会直接开到你面前。
Be courteous to other drivers, and in turn they will be courteous to you. 
对其他司机要有礼貌，反过来他们也会对你有礼貌。

In terms of taking lanes, remember the following two rules:98  
关于走车道，请记住以下两条规则：
1)  Ride  with the cars (be in the correct turn lane). 
1） 和汽车一样骑行（在正确的转弯车道上）。
2) The faster you go relative to the speed limit, the more of the lane you should take. 
2） 相对于限速，你走得越快，你应该走的车道就越多。
If you go 15mph and the speed limit is 15mph, you should be close to the middle of the lane. 
如果你以25公里/小时的速度行驶，并且限速为25公里/小时，你应该靠近车道中间。
If you go 15mph and the speed limit is 55mph, you should be close to the edge of the lane; once you go downhill  and  start  pushing  40mph,  you  can  start  taking  more  lane. 
如果你以25公里/小时的速度行驶，限速为90公里/小时，你应该靠近车道边缘；一旦你走下坡路，开始以65公里/小时的速度前进，你就可以开始走更多的车道了。
This automatically  avoids  you  getting  squeezed  and  it  puts  you  in  the  right  position during turns at light crossings. 
这会自动避免你被挤压，并使你在转弯时处于正确的位置。
Speaking of light crossings, a regular rider on a well-geared  commuting  or  road  bike  (not  a  cruiser  or  a  mountain  bike)  will easily be able to out-accelerate any car starting from a standstill when the green light  changes--trucks  in  particular  won't  be  able  to  catch  up  until  at  least  after 100yards  or  so. 
说到轻型道口，一个经常骑着装备良好的通勤或公路自行车（不是巡洋舰或山地自行车）的人，在绿灯变亮时，很容易就能超过任何一辆从静止状态出发的汽车——尤其是卡车，它们至少在大约100米后才能赶上来。
A  sedentary  rider  generally  won't  be  able  to  do  this. 
久坐的骑手通常无法做到这一点。
Doing  so represents  both  a  physiological  challenge,  a  perceptive  barrier,  and  to  some extent a safety problem for beginners--get off the bike and use the crosswalk if in doubt. 
这样做既是生理上的挑战，也是感知上的障碍，在某种程度上也是初学者的安全问题——如果有疑问，就下车走人行横道。
Never ride across the crosswalk; it's illegal, dangerous, and annoying. 
千万不要穿过人行横道；这是非法的，危险的，令人讨厌的。
Riding  an  underpowered  bike,  or  more  accurately,  riding  a  bike  underpowered will decrease one's confidence as much as driving a significantly underpowered motorized vehicle. 
骑动力不足的自行车，或者更准确地说，骑动力不足的自行车会像驾驶动力严重不足的机动车一样降低人们的自信心。

If it's cold, move faster, or add a layer. 
如果天气很冷，请加快移动速度，或多穿一层。
Experienced people tend to start out underdressed,  knowing  exactly  what  their  moving  "comfort  level"  is. 
有经验的人一开始往往穿着随便，他们确切地知道他们移动的“舒适度”是多少。
Comfort can be achieved by moving faster or slower. 
舒适感可以通过更快或更慢的移动来实现。

If  it's  warm,  the  problem  becomes  more  difficult. 
如果天气暖和，问题就更难解决了。
It's  very  common  to  be "air-conditioned"  to  low  heat  tolerances. 
这是常见的“空调”降低热耐受性。
What  happens  is  that  air-conditioning makes sweat glands ineffective as they're never called into use. 
结果是，空调使汗腺无效，因为它们从未被使用过。
This means that when moving outside in the hot air, more blood has to be directed away from the core and the muscles to cool the body. 
这意味着，当在热空气中向外移动时，必须将更多血液从核心和肌肉中流出，以冷却身体。
If the skin becomes flushed when exposed to  warm  temperatures,  that  is  a  sign  of  air-conditioned  sweat  glands  that  have been rendered ineffective. 
如果皮肤暴露在温暖的温度下会发红，这是空调汗腺失效的迹象。
This leaves less blood for the muscles. 
这就减少了肌肉所需的血液。
In effect, living with air conditioning is like exercising after eating a big meal, in which case the blood  would  be  around  your  stomach  area. 
实际上，有空调的生活就像吃了一顿大餐后锻炼一样，在这种情况下，血液会在你的胃周围。
This  effect  can  be  dramatic. 
这种影响可能是戏剧性的。
For instance,  people  who  are  used  to  training  hard,  but  indoors  in  air  conditioned buildings, run out of energy and oxygen very quickly if they have to repeat the feat  outdoors  in  30C  (86F)  or  higher  temperatures  because  their  circulatory system simply isn't used to the extra load. 
例如，那些习惯于艰苦训练，但在有空调的室内训练的人，如果在30℃（86℉）或更高的温度下在室外重复训练，他们的能量和氧气会很快耗尽，因为他们的循环系统根本不适应额外的负荷。

The best type of bicycle for commuting is probably a touring bike, as it goes fast, far, and carries a load. 
最好的通勤自行车可能是旅行自行车，因为它走得快、远，而且负载大。
The ideal frame is steel. 
理想的框架是钢制的。
Steel is durable, and unlike carbon,  it  doesn't  fail  catastrophically. 
钢是耐用的，与碳纤不同，它不会发生灾难性的失效。
If  you're  going  to  commute  by  bicycle, don't  be  afraid  of  spending  a  couple  thousand  or  more  on  a  bicycle. 
如果你打算骑自行车上下班，不要害怕在自行车上花费几千美元或更多。
If  you maintain it well, it will last you the rest of your life. 
如果你能很好地维护它，它将持续到你的余生。
After all, most people spend more on their cars, which generally only last about a decade.
毕竟，大多数人花在汽车上的钱更多，而汽车通常只能使用十年左右。

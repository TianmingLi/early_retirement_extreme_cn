Few consciously think about complex strategies in daily living.

很少人认真思考过日常生活的复杂策略。

 On a daily
basis, a functional strategy is invisible.

在基本的日常生活中，基本的策略是不可见的。

 Rarely do we step back and re-examine
our strategy (lifestyle design). 

我们很少会后退和重新检验我们的策略（生活方式设计）。

Most of the time we simply adopt the tactics that
are handed down through the system without a second thought (see The Lock-
on).

大多数时间我们只是用手头的系统做了简单的适配，没有再多想一秒（参见[锁住](4-锁住.md)）。


Now, it's possible to improve normal consumer budgets by several percent by
utilizing tips and hacks to optimize the efficiency of existing tactics.

现在，通过利用小提示和优化存在的战术的效率，提高一定百分比的日常的消费预算是有可能的。

 Keep in
mind, however, that hacking existing methods isn't going to accomplish the same
level of satisfaction as devising new methods that are more suitable to the new
strategy. 

记住，然而，这种优化已有方法和发展出更有适应性的策略的满足感步骤一个层次上。

One doesn't win a trench war against machine guns by improving the
cavalry.  

提高骑兵的战斗力不能在堑壕战中战胜机枪。

Substantial  improvements  don't  happen  incrementally  by  patching
existing methods; they require a complete redesign.

令人满意的改进不可能是在已有方法上打补丁实现；它们需要完全地重新设计。

Until now, we have concentrated on the theoretical foundations and guiding
principles of the Renaissance life. 

直到现在，我们才集中到文艺复兴式生活的理论基础和指导原则。

In this chapter I'll describe the trees of this
forest. 

这章中我会描述这片森林里的树木。

Just as early humans built fires and shelter and planted seeds to modify
their environment, we should modify our environment in ways that are beneficial
rather than detrimental to our goals. 

就像早期人类生火和种植种子来改变他们的环境，我们应该以一直互利的方式修改我们的环境，而不是为了我们的目标不择手段。

When the environment can't be changed,
we'll adapt ourselves to flow along with the environment instead of struggling
against  it. 

当环境不能改变时，我们会让自己适应环境而不挣扎着对抗它。

 It  should  be  realized  that  it'll  rarely  be  possible  to  change  the
environment on a grand scale and build a utopia--that is, unless you and the rest
of the world all do what I say. 

已经被意识到的是，大规模地改造环境和建立一个乌托邦是几乎不可能的——也就是，除非你和世界上的其他人都这么做。

Most tactics will therefore be executed in the
current  environment.  

很多战术会在当前的环境里执行。

However,  they'll  often  be  carried  out  with  an  entirely
different  goal  in  mind--becoming  independently  wealthy  and  financially
independent within five years.

然而，它们都会带着一个完全不同的目标——五年内财富独立和经济独立。

The methods for doing so will be simple. 

这么做的方法会是很简单的。

I won't present any tips that haven't
been seen before and which one can't find described in detail in hundreds of
other  books. 

我不会一一列出所有的未曾见过的小提示，这些都是在几百本书里也找不出来的。

 Success  won't  depend  on  becoming  famous  on  the  Internet  or
getting  a  book  deal,  nor  will  it  depend  on  a  timely  participation  in  a  market
bubble  of  junk  bonds,  internet  companies,  real  estate,  gold,  or  tulips.  

成功不依赖于成为网红，或者成为畅销书作者，也不依赖于某个特定时间的市场泡沫，互联网工作，不动产，黄金和郁金香。

It  also
won't  depend  on  successfully  starting  your  own  business. 

它也不依赖于成功开始你自己的生意。

 You  won't  need  to
develop a particular specialized skill such as real estate flipping. 

你不需要发展一种特别的技能例如不动产翻转。

In fact, if you
have a job, keep it. However, using the methods in a way that aligns your goals
and  side  effects  persistently  and  consistently  to  achieve  financial  or  job-
independence is not easy.

事实上，如果你还有工作，留着它。然而，使用这种方法来接近你的目标，侧面影响会永久和持续地获取经济或工作——独立不是容易的。

 You must be willing to change your frame of mind and
conquer old habits. 

你必须愿意改变你的思维框架和战胜旧的习惯。

In particular, you must be willing to do things that 95% of
the population won't be able to understand and 99% won't be willing to do. 

特别的，你必须愿意做95%的人不愿意理解的事，和99%不愿意做的事。

This
means that you must be exceedingly confident that you're doing the right thing,
which is why 90% of this book is dedicated to the development of a coherent
philosophy.

这就意味着你必须极度自信于你做的是对的，这也是为什么这本书90%都在开发一种一致性的哲学。

Freedom is attained by creating a large gap between production (revenue)
and consumption (expenses). 

自由是在生产（收入）和消耗（消费）间划出很大的间隔。

This can be done in two ways--earning more or
spending less.

这能通过两种方法实现——赚更多或者花更少。

 Nothing new there.

这里没有新东西。

Which of the two you prefer depends on individual circumstances.

这两个里你喜欢哪个取决你的个人喜好。

 If you're
easily capable of producing more, you'll frame freedom as the opportunity to
produce  more. 

如果你能容易地胜任产出更多，你的自由框架可能是产出更多。

 If  producing  more  requires  significant  effort,  you'll  frame
freedom as not having to produce more.

如果高产出要求特别多的投入，你的自由框架就不必产出那么多。

 In an affluent and wealthy society, the
latter is much more easily achieved by most, including myself.

在一个富足的社会，后种情况是大多数人很容易获得的，包括我。

 There was and is
no  way  I  could  increase  my  income  by  a  factor  of  four,  but  it  was  certainly
possible to reduce my expenses to a quarter of their former level. 

我增加4倍收入很困难，但是，把我的花费减少的它们1/4却绝对可能。

I think this
holds for the greater part of the bell curve of incomes. 

我认为占据了收入钟形曲线的重要部分。

Unless you're very poor
(income <  $4,000  /  year)  or  very  rich  (income  >  $400,000  /  year),  boosting
income is very difficult. 

除非你非常穷（年收入小于4千刀）或非常富（年收入大于4万刀），显著增加收入是非常困难的。

If done intelligently, a little money will go a long way.

如果做的明智，一点钱就能坚持非常久。

Unfortunately, in this age money is rarely spent intelligently. 

不幸的是，当今钱很少花的非常明智。

So by practicing
intelligent  asset  management,  it's  possible  to  live  wealthily  without  spending
nearly as much as the average.

通过明智的资产管理，就可能生活的很富足但是不用花的接近平均消费水平。

On an absolute scale, spending less also allows for much greater choice in
how  you  earn  your  money. 

在一个绝对的尺度上，花的少也允许你在赚钱是有更好的选择。

 Currently,  the  money  I  spend  could  be  acquired
through a part-time job as a burger flipper--just imagine the riches a full-time job
could bring. 

现在，我花的钱可以从汉堡翻饼员这个兼职工作中获取，一个富有的全职工作想想都会枯燥。

Alternatively, I currently acquire my income as an amateur asset
manager or capitalist using a little over five years of personal savings as  my
capital base (see Financial independence and investing). 

取而代之的，我当前通过作为一个资深的资产或资本管理者获得收入，这些资本基础用了一点我五年的个人储蓄（参见[财务独立和投资]()）。

Since being a capitalist
takes very little effort when you don't have to write progress reports or win new
customers,  I  can  dedicate  most  of  my  time  to  my  primary  passion,  which  is
writing. 

因为成为资本家只需要投入很少的经历，你不必写进度报告或者赢取新客户，我能掌控我的大多数时间投入到我最热衷的事情，也就是写作。

The strategy described in this chapter focuses on living inexpensively in
a culture dedicated to extravagance, productivity, and material waste.

这章里描述的策略关注生活地不昂贵，在这样的被超平均、高生产和材料浪费决定的文化里。

 It follows
these guidelines:
Reduce wants and needs from the marketplace to a minimum to decouple
the buy-work connection.

它遵循如下的指导原则：

- 减少欲望和需求，把和市场间的购买连接解耦到最小化。


Decrease  the  volume  and  size  but  increase  the  sophistication  of  your
activities and possessions.

- 减少你财产和活动的规模和容量但是增加它们的精细复杂度。

Measure prosperity by less activity, not more. Do fewer useless things.
Work for the purpose of earning money for no more than five years of your

life or five hours a week.

- 用较少的活动而不是更多来衡量繁荣。少做没用的事情。以赚不多于5年花的钱，每周工作5小时为目的工作。

Avoid generating waste and find ways to use the waste of others.

- 避免产生浪费，找出使用别人浪费东西的方法。

Learn to use the system to your advantage, but don't be evil!

- 学习让这个系统为你所用，但是不要做恶！

Serve yourself rather than having others serve you. 

- 自我服务而不让他人服务你。

Instead, help them.

取而代之的，帮助他们。

Keep running costs down but pay for value.

- 坚持少花费但是为价值付钱。

Maintain health to avoid the personal and monetary cost of sickness.

- 保持健康来避免天价医疗费。

Build up the capital to live as a capitalist or the skills to always find a new
job.

- 建立资本，成为靠资本生活的资本家，或者永远能找到新工作的技能。

Focus on productive assets rather than stuff.

- 关注生产资产而不是物品。

Focus on developing skills rather than on passive entertainment.

- 关注发展技能而不是消极娱乐。

Gain the maximum in satisfaction with the minimum expenditure of money
and energy.

- 以最小的金钱和能量获得最大的满足感。

Reintegration is an important part of this design. 

重新整合式这种设计的重要部分。

Normal life (see The lock-
in)  has  maximized  separation  (see  Economic  degrees  of  freedom)  due  to  an
underlying engineering frame of mind (minimize degrees of freedom) and the
economic  idea  of  comparative  advantage,  with  outsourcing  being  its  latest
manifestation. 

常规的生活（参见[锁住]()）有最大化的分散（参见[经济上的自由度]()），由于思维模式的驱动方式（最小化自由度）和经济上上的比较优势的想法，所以外包是它最后的工具。

 This  separation  occurs  not  just  over  the  span  of  decades  with
schooling, working, and retirement happening in three separate time periods, but
also on a daily basis, where people drive dozens of miles away from their home
for  a  set  amount  of  hours  in  their  separate  cars  and  then  return  late  to  their
separate houses in the early evening to consume stuff acquired elsewhere.

这种分散不只是以一定时间分隔发生在学校、工作和退休这三个阶段，也发生在日常的琐事中，人们开上十几里路和车子分离，待上几个小时，然后回到分离的房子，开始消耗从其他地方获取的东西。

What worked for me was reintegrating much of this behavior, to eliminate
the personal inefficiencies this way of life creates.

对我来说有效的是重组这些行为，消除这种生活方式里的无效率的行为。

 For instance, I lived close to
work; most of my work I do at home, because it's mostly telecommuting work.

比如，我住的和工作很近，大多数工作我在家完成，因为大多数是电话上的工作。

 I
don't dress up for work, but according to season. 

我不穿正装上班，我穿平常四季的衣服。

I get around not by car, but by
foot and bicycle, which provides free exercise. 

我在周围不开车，但是步行或骑自行车，这也提供了一种免费的锻炼。

I retired from my career, but I
still work, and I still learn. 

我从我的职业里退休了，但是我仍然工作，仍然学习。

Hence, I no longer get divided and conquered under
the guise of comparative advantage.

因此我不用再被分割和被比较优势的伪装所占据。

In the following descriptions I have omitted many details of implementation-
-consider  them  left  as  exercises  for  the  student--whose  inclusion  would
otherwise  result  in  this  book  being  several  hundred  pages  longer. 

在下面的描述中，我会忽略很多实现细节，把它们作为练习留给学生，否则这本书会比现在再长几百页。

 All  the
technical details can be learned from other books and websites in a matter of
months. 

所有能从书中和网上学到的技术细节只是个把月的事情。

I trust that the reader, after hearing about a specific method, will be able
to fill in the blanks.

我相信读者，再听到这个特殊的方法以后，会有能力填上这个空白。

 For instance, if I suggest making your own laundry detergent
or a self-watering container, I trust the reader to find the pertinent details on the
Internet. 

例如，如果我建议你自制洗衣剂或者自供水容器，我相信读者能在网上找到相关的细节。

This leaves the technicalities to the reader and I can restrict myself to
pointing out what to look for and how to devise a strategy.

把技术细节留给读者，这样我就能严格关注如何找寻和怎么设计策略了。

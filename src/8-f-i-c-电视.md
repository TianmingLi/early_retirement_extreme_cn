I  have  nothing  good  to  say  about  TV. 
我对电视没什么好话说。
While  I  can't  prove  its  universal disutility, I think not having a TV, or at least not watching it, is a big factor when it  comes  to  choosing  unconventional  paths. 
虽然我无法证明它的普遍无用性，但我认为，在选择非传统路径时，没有电视，或者至少不看电视，是一个重要因素。
Naturally,  there's  this  popular  idea that TV feeds the masses with certain values, but I believe this is exaggerated.101 Most  programming  offers  fairly  reticent  opinions  and  is  quite  free  of  actual content. 
自然，有一种流行的观点认为电视以特定的价值观来填饱大众，但我认为这被夸大了。大多数节目提供了相当沉默的观点，并且完全没有实际内容。
The great beauty of TV is therefore not so much that it acts as a form of active  propaganda  filling  people  with  new  ideas,  but  that  it  keeps  people  from having new ideas in the first place. 
因此，电视的伟大魅力不在于它是一种积极的宣传形式，让人们充满新思想，而在于它首先阻止人们产生新思想。

When  TV  was  invented,  it  was  thought  to  be  a  great  opportunity,  a  great teaching tool for quickly reaching the masses. 
当电视被发明时，它被认为是一个很好的机会，一个很好的教学工具，可以很快地接触到大众。
However, ironically, it turned out that  TV  was  much  better  at  keeping  people  from  learning. 
然而，讽刺的是，事实证明，电视更能阻止人们学习。
This  fits  perfectly with  the  focus  on  specialization. 
这完全符合对专业化的关注。
During  the  day,  professionals  attend  to  their jobs. 
白天，专业人士会负责他们的工作。
During the evenings, they vegetate in front of their TVs, thereby prevented from  learning  anything,  and  this  effectively  keeps  them  in  their  jobs. 
晚上，他们在电视机前无所事事，因此无法学习任何东西，这有效地让他们继续工作。
Actually, the  closer  you  get  to  middle-class  values  and  neighborhoods,  the  greater  the preponderance of silent streets; all you see in the evening are empty streets and a faint blue hue emanating from behind the curtains of every house. 
事实上，你越接近中产阶级的价值观和社区，沉默的街道的优势就越大；晚上，你所看到的只是空无一人的街道，每家每户的窗帘后面都散发出淡淡的蓝色。

In my experience, by going cold turkey, it takes about a week to get rid of a TV addiction. 
根据我的经验，彻底戒掉电视瘾大约需要一周的时间。
There's no pain, save an empty spot in the room and perhaps the loss of hundreds of imaginary friends (mostly detectives, doctors, lawyers, and spaceship  captains)  you  have  vicariously  lived  through  yet  learned  nothing about. 
这里没有痛苦，除了房间里的一个空位，也许还有数百个假想朋友（大多是侦探、医生、律师和宇宙飞船船长）的损失，这些都是你经历过的，但你对他们一无所知。
If you still need your fix, you can swap, borrow, or rent DVDs and watch those instead.
如果你仍然需要修复，你可以交换、借用或租赁DVD，取而代之。

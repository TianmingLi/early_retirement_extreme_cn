Throughout their education (see Sigmoids, logistic curves, and the maximum power  principle),  people  have  been  told  what  to  think,  and  throughout  their careers  (see  Career)  they  have  been  told  what  to  do  and  what  to  say. 
在他们的整个教育过程中（参见[S型曲线、逻辑曲线和最大能量原则]()），人们被告知要思考什么，在他们的整个职业生涯中（参见[职业]()），人们被告知要做什么和说什么。
 Being constantly  bombarded  with  "facts"  and  opinions,  many  people  simply  adopt them  as  their  own  (see  Succession  and  the  cycle  of  change). 
由于不断受到“事实”和观点的炮轰，许多人干脆把它们当作自己的东西（参见[演替和变化的循环]()）。
 Most  people therefore  do  not  think  for  themselves,  but  rely  on  others  to  do  it  for  them. 
因此，大多数人不为自己思考，而是依靠他人为自己思考。
Consequently,  many  people  follow  authority,  rely  on  experts,  and  get  their opinions from pundits and the Internet. 
因此，许多人追随权威，依靠专家，从专家和互联网上获得他们的意见。

Critical thinking doesn't come naturally. 
批判性思维不是天生的。
It is a discipline that can be learned, but  unfortunately  schools  don't  seem  to  do  a  good  job  of  teaching  it. 
这是一门可以学习的学科，但不幸的是，学校似乎没有把它教好。
 When critical  thinking  is  taught,  it's  typically  compartmentalized  to  the  student's particular specialization. 
当教授批判性思维时，它通常被划分为学生的特定专业。
Consequently, a person may be able to think critically when it comes to the life cycle of the fruit fly or late 19th century Indian fiction (see  The  cost  of  specialization),  but  is  otherwise  unable  to  apply  the  methods elsewhere, because the general principles of rational thought are not taught. 
因此，当涉及到果蝇的生命周期或19世纪末印度小说时，一个人可能能够进行批判性思考（见[专业化的代价]()），但在其他方面，则无法应用这些方法，因为他没有被教授理性思维的一般原则。
Yet without  critical  thinking  skills,  there's  no  way  of  correctly  solving  problems yourself (see Building blocks) and no way of critically questioning your life and your surroundings. 
然而，如果没有批判性思维技能，就没有办法自己正确地解决问题（参见[构建模块]()），也没有办法批判性地，质疑你的生活和周围环境。
Relying on outside analysis of those areas restricts the scope of choices, whereas your own critical analysis and synthesis create new choices. 
依赖这些领域的外部分析，会限制选择的范围，而你自己的批判性分析和综合，会创建新的选择。
It makes you a leader rather than a follower. 
它使你成为领导者而不是追随者。
The average person is a follower. 
一般人都是追随者。

Aside from being able to think, one should also know what to think about. 
除了能够思考，一个人还应该知道该思考什么。
If thinking is the tool, knowledge is the resource. 
如果说思维是工具，那么知识就是资源。
It's only by combining these that productive solutions can be formed. 
只有将这些结合起来，才能形成富有成效的解决方案。
There are few combinations more dangerous than  an  intelligent  person  without  knowledge,  experience,  and  wisdom. 
没有什么组合比，一个没有知识、经验和智慧的聪明人，更危险。
 In general, the wider the scope of one's knowledge, the greater one's ability to think laterally  and  the  more  creative  the  solutions  become. 
一般来说，一个人的知识范围越广，他横向思考的能力就越强，解决方案也就越有创意。
 The  Renaissance  man should therefore acquire knowledge from many different fields so as to have the intellectual  horsepower  to  solve  many  different  kinds  of  problems. 
因此，文艺复兴时期的人应该从许多不同的领域获得知识，以便有能力解决许多不同的问题。
 Also,  he should  acknowledge  that  breadth  of  knowledge  is  inherently  valuable  and  that learning should not stop when leaving school. 
此外，他应该承认知识的广度具有内在价值，离开学校时学习不应该停止。

Intellectual goals for someone aspiring to be a Renaissance man are to be  able  to  prioritize  the  relevance  of  information  and  be  able  to  quickly research  and  find  relevant  information  in  many  different  areas. 
对于有志成为文艺复兴人的人来说，他们的智力目标是能够优先考虑信息的相关性，并能够快速研究，和找到许多不同领域的相关信息。

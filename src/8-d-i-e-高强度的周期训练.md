There is an absolute standard of fitness. 

To be fit is to be able to drag or carry an  unconscious  adult  out  of  a  burning  house  on  one,  maybe  two  gulps  of  air. 

Alternatively, it's to outsprint a dog, given a head start, and climb over a 7ft wall. 

To be fit is to be able to fight and defeat anyone who can outrun you and outrun anyone you can't defeat. 


The  most  effective  way  to  reach  that  particular  kind  of  fitness  is  high- intensity interval training, and the best way I can think of that won't cost an arm and a leg in equipment or gym fees is the "clean and pushpress." It is a full-body movement,  which  strengthens  practically  the  entire  body  from  the  neck  to  the knees. 


The clean and push press works practically all the muscles in your body and it's  a  great  power  movement. 

If  your  desire  is  to  be  strong  (but  with  less endurance), the ultimate exercise is the deadlift. 


If done with dumbbells or kettlebells, these are relatively simple movements. 

If  done  with  a  barbell,  you  may  want  to  get  someone  to  show  you. 

I  prefer kettlebells. 

Do-it-yourselfers  may  realize  the  same  benefits  by  filling  a  sturdy duffel bag with sandbags made out of duct taped Zip-loc bags.86 


A  high  work  capacity  is  physically  equivalent  to  sustaining  a  high  power output (keeping a light bulb lit on a rowing machine), which means being able to do  a  lot  of  work  in  a  short  time  (stacking  sacks  of  corn). 

Since  this  is  very exhausting, training is done in intervals. 


The optimal interval for strength and endurance is the Tabata interval, which means  20  seconds  of  all-out  exercise  followed  by  10  seconds  of  rest  and repeating this sequence throughout the entire workout; that is, working roughly 2/3 of the time. 

Increasing the weight and rest-to-work ratio prioritizes strength. 

Decreasing  the  weight  and  rest-to-work  ratio  prioritizes  endurance. 

Pure endurance aims for working 100% of the time. 


To  increase  work  capacity,  a  good  progression  is  first  to  increase  strength, then to increase volume, and then finally to increase power by shortening the rest intervals. 

It works like this: 

1.Increase  strength  sufficiently  to  do  a  few  reps. 

This  is  efficiently  done  by using this entire program at a lower strength requirement at first. 

2. Build up the volume. 

Suppose the entire volume is 100 repetitions. 

In this case  do  100  reps  with  enough  rest  in  between  to  finish. 

You  may  take  all day if you like--for example, doing 5 reps every hour all day until you reach 100. 

Once  you  can  do  this  every  other  day  without  overtraining,  move  to the next step. 

3. Unless you picked a completely unrealistic strength level, most people will start at this point. 

Now, 100 reps can be divided into 100 reps×1 set, 50×2, 33×3,  25×4,  20×5,  18×6,  14×7,  13×8,  11×9,  10×10,  etc. 

Doing  1  set should  take  exactly  1  minute,  rest  included  (use  a  watch!). 

Hence,  33×3 will take 33 minutes to complete. 

The program adjusts with power capacity- -for example, once 18×6 can be completed in good form, move on to 14×7. 

Once you reach 7×14, say, rest periods will be very short and you will be close to being able to do the exercise continuously, for example, as a power- endurance exercise. 

At this point move to a higher strength level and start over. 


This is a very generalized way of laying out a program and it can be used for any kind of exercise such  as  push-ups,  squats,  power  cleans,  rowing,  sprinting, etc. 

The  good  thing  about  it  is  that  it  adjusts. 

You  will  probably  find  yourself making  great  strides  in  the  first  month,  particularly  if  you're  untrained,  as neuromuscular  connections  adapt. 

After  that,  progression  will  be  much  slower. 

Also note that at the more advanced stages the entire workout will take less than 10 minutes, yet the volume will be as high as what regular people spend an hour in the gym completing.

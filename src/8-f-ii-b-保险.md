The way insurance works is that a company takes premiums from a pool of people and pays it out to those who have accidents and make claims.
保险的运作方式是，一家公司从一群人那里收取保费，并将其支付给发生事故并提出索赔的人。
Actuaries are generally very good as estimating how accident-prone groups of people are, and  the  difference  between  take-in  and  pay-out  is  generally  low  (this  is  also known as the combined ratio).
精算师通常能够很好地估计出事故多发人群的情况，而收入和支出之间的差异通常很小（这也被称为综合比率）。
Insurance  companies  thus  make  their  money by holding your money, called the float, and investing it for their own profit.
因此，保险公司通过持有你的资金，即所谓的浮动，并通过进行投资来赚钱。

Since  the  insurance  company  is  willing  to  take  the  bet  in  return  for  the proceeds  from  investing  the  float,  it  means  that  you  should  not  take  the  bet unless  your  financial  loss  would  be  catastrophic--or  you  know  better  than  the actuaries.
由于保险公司愿意以投资浮存金的收益作为赌注，这意味着你不应该下注，除非你的财务损失将是灾难性的——或者你比精算师懂得更好。
Furthermore, you also have the opportunity to proactively reduce the risks.
此外，你还有机会主动降低风险。
If you think about the potential consequences of everything you do--that is, careful--you can substantially reduce your risk.
如果你仔细考虑你所做的每件事的潜在后果，也就是说，你可以大大降低风险。
On the other hand, if you know your  behavior  is  risky,  paying  for  insurance  might  be  worthwhile,  unless  the insurance company also knows this, in which case they will simply charge you more.
另一方面，如果你知道自己的行为有风险，支付保险费可能是值得的，除非保险公司也知道这一点，在这种情况下，他们只会向你收取更多费用。

Many insurance plans are better thought of as financing than insurance.
许多保险计划被认为是融资而不是保险。
This holds  for  insurance  plans  that  pay  for  regular  maintenance such  as  health  and dental.
这适用于支付健康和牙科等定期维护费用的保险计划。
Here the cost of the maintenance gets added to the premium along with a profit  for  the  insurance  company,  similar  to  how  a  credit  company  collects interest.
在这里，维护费用与保险公司的利润一起计入保费，类似于信贷公司收取利息的方式。
They would not offer these fully loaded plans unless it was unprofitable for you.
他们不会提供这些满负荷的计划，除非对你无利可图。

Preventing  catastrophic,  that  is,  irrecoverable  losses  is  the  only  reason  to carry insurance.
防止灾难性的，即无法挽回的损失是投保的唯一理由。
Effectively, this means carrying as high a deductible as possible while  at  the  same  time  having  enough  funds,  which  you  can  invest,  to  cover losses up to that deductible.
实际上，这意味着尽可能高的免赔额，同时拥有足够的资金，你可以投资，以弥补该免赔额的损失。
Oftentimes, people carry too much insurance simply because  they  don't  have  the  money  on  hand  to  cover  the  deductible.
通常，人们购买过多保险仅仅是因为他们手头没有足够的钱来支付免赔额。
This shouldn't  be  a  problem  for  you  though,  and  so  you'll  profit.
这对你来说应该不是问题，所以你会获利。
Another  common argument is that the monthly premium is low.
另一个常见的论点是，每月的保费很低。
This is like saying that a stock is cheap because it trades for $3.
这就像说一只股票便宜是因为它的价格是3美元。
This argument is common for renter's insurance.
这种观点在租房者保险中很常见。
However,  this  is  a  case  where  it  should  be  easy  to  have  the  funds  to  replace anything  that  was  lost  which  can  be  bought.
然而，在这种情况下，应该很容易有资金来替换任何可以购买的丢失的东西。
Especially  when  considering  the methods  in  How  to  get  things.
尤其是在考虑[如何获得东西]()的方法时。
Furthermore,  it  saves  the  hassle  of  battling  the insurance companies, which have a habit of routinely denying the first claim.
此外，它还省去了与保险公司抗争的麻烦，因为保险公司习惯于拒绝第一次索赔。

Some insurances are not necessary.
有些保险是不必要的。
Once you're financially independent, you don't  need  unemployment  insurance.
一旦你经济独立了，你就不需要失业保险了。
You  don't  need  life  insurance,  as  your estate's  assets  can  simply  support  another  dependent.
你不需要人寿保险，因为你的财产可以简单地供养另一个家属。
You  don't  need  disability insurance since you don't need to work to live.

If you don't have a car, you don't need car insurance either.
如果你没有车，你也不需要汽车保险。
If you own your home outright, you don't need "home mortgage holder's" insurance.
如果你完全拥有自己的房子，你不需要“住房抵押贷款持有人”保险。
If your home comprises a substantial part of your assets (not a good idea), you would want to carry some form of insurance, as a loss would be catastrophic insofar as you would not be able or willing to save up the money to buy a new one in a few years.
如果你的房子占你资产的很大一部分（这不是一个好主意），你会想购买某种形式的保险，因为损失将是灾难性的，因为你无法或不愿意攒钱在几年内购买一套新房子。

Whether or not to insure should be a rational decision based on one's risk of loss and ability to survive the loss.
是否投保应该是基于一个人的损失风险和承受损失的能力的理性决定。
Most of us don't insure our clothes or tools.
我们大多数人不为自己的衣服或工具投保。
For a financially independent person, this will extend much further since almost everything can be replaced many times over.
对于一个经济独立的人来说，这将进一步扩大，因为几乎所有的东西都可以多次更换。

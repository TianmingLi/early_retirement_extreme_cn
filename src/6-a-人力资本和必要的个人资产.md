As mentioned in The lock-in, it is interesting that we refer to "primitive"
people27 as primitive, 

如在“锁住”章节提到的，我们把“原始的人”定义为原始是非常有意思的，

when every primitive person is able to build his own tools
and shelter, make his own clothes, provide heat and water, and knows what food
is edible and what isn't. 

当每一个原始人有能力建造自己的工具和庇护所，制作自己的衣服，提供温暖和水，知道哪些食物能吃哪些不能。

How many of us are capable of that?

我们中有多少人能做到这点？


 His technology
may be primitive, but his general knowledge of his world far surpasses ours. 

他的技术可能是原始的，但是在他的世界里他的通用知识是远胜于我们的。

A "primitive" can competently participate in every aspect of what his culture does.

一个“原始的人”能够完整地参与到他文化中的各个方面。

In contrast, we only know something about a very limited number of things in
our culture, 

作为对照，我们只知道我们文化中的非常有限的一点东西，

such as our job training and functions, and the only thing we share in
common are opinions about local restaurants, the fictitious lives of the characters
in  a  couple  of  TV  serials,  and  a  rudimentary  understanding  of  the  weather
forecast. 

随着我们的工作训练和进行，这仅有的一点常识性的东西也是关于当地饭馆，电视节目上的生活家具，对于天气预报的理解。

In that regard, our society is more akin to a highly developed insect
colony where specialized members work for the greater whole.

这就代表着，我们的社会更接近高度发展的群居昆虫，特化的个体为更好的整体工作。


Given the lack of diversity of individuals' skills, the popular measure of how
well we're doing is given by a single number: Our net worth, or salary for those
who don't have a net worth.

由于缺乏个人技能的多样性，评价我们的标准也被给定了一个单一的数值：我们的净值，对于那些没有净值的人来说则是薪水。

 Open any book on personal finance and one of the
first numbers introduced is the concept of net worth. 

打开任何一个关于个人财务的书籍，第一介绍的都是净值。


Your net worth is equal to
the sum of all your financial assets, house, investments, and possessions minus
the  sum  of  all  your  financial  liabilities,  mortgages,  and  loans. 

你的净值等于你的财产、房子、投资加和，然后减去财务负担、按揭、贷款。

 This  can  be
positive or negative, but it is still a one-dimensional number.

这或正或复，但它仍然是一维数字。

Net worth is only useful as a measuring stick if everybody plays the same
game and has the same form of consumption.

净值只有在玩同一游戏并且有相同消耗的时候，才能作为一个有用的测量尺。

 It is only useful in a world where
money is earned with one skill and the lack of all other skills is compensated for by spending money.

它只有在一个缺乏其他技能，只能用一种技能赚钱，然后比拼花钱的世界中有用。


However, real people, even specialists, are not so one-dimensional. 

然而，真正的人，即使是专业人士，也不只是一维的。

A person
may be able to cook his own food (reheating pizzas or boiling noodles is not
cooking!). 

一个人能够自己做饭（加热披萨和煮面条不算！）。

 Compared  to  a  person  that  needs  to  go  out  to  eat  or  buy  more
expensive preprocessed food, that skill is an asset, because the person needs less
money to eat.

和那些需要到外面吃或者买昂贵加工食品的人比，这项技能是财产，因为吃饭可以花更少的钱。

 Yet how does one put a price on this asset?28 Similarly, a person
with a high-paying job may be chronically stressed or sedentary and thus at a
higher risk of developing various lifestyle diseases. 

然而，如何为这一资产定价？ 同样，从事高薪工作的人可能会长期承受压力或久坐不动，因此患各种生活方式疾病的风险更高。

Yet how does one put a price
on this liability?


然而，人们如何为这一负债定价呢？

It may not be possible to put a precise price on such assets and liabilities, but
it's  possible  to  draw  a  diagram  that  illustrates  them.  
可能无法对此类资产和负债进行准确定价，但可以绘制说明它们的图表。

This  figure  shows  the
scenario  for  a  locked-in  person  as  described  in  The lock-in. 

此[图]()展示了[锁住]()中描述的被锁住的人的场景。

 On  the  x-axis is
shown various areas of a person's life--working, living, eating, etc.

x轴显示了一个人生活的各个方面——工作、生活、饮食等。

 Also shown
is a dashed line that demarcates areas where the person is paying and where the
person is getting paid. 

还显示了一条虚线，该虚线划定了花钱的区域和赚钱的区域。

A locked-in person has almost no useful skills. The one
skill  they  do  have  provides  all  of  their  income.  

一个被锁住的人几乎没有有用的技能。他们拥有的一项技能提供了他们所有的收入。

Consequently,  a  locked-in
specialist gets paid for only a single area, but he is paid a lot, as the tall spike
indicates. 

因此，锁住的专家只会在一个领域获得报酬，但正如大的尖峰所示，他的报酬很高。

This is the same spike as in this figure. Yet all other areas are below
the dashed line, indicating that those areas must be paid for.

这是此[图]()中的相同尖峰。然而所有其他区域都低于虚线，表明这些区域必须付费。

This figure shows the degree of skills for a locked-in person. 

该图显示了锁住的人的技能程度。

The
dashed line demarcates the point where a person neither spends nor receives
money. 

虚线划定了一个人既不花钱也不赚钱的点。

In other words, the person is able to do this activity for free. Notice
that for the locked-in person, most activities cost money. These activities
are all supported by a single skill-based income.

换句话说，此人可以免费进行此活动。请注意，对于被锁住的人来说，大多数活动都需要花钱。这些活动都由单一的技能收入支持的。

Contrast this with a person who has multiple personal skill-assets, as in this
figure. 

将此与拥有多项个人技能资产的人进行对比，如[图]()所示。

While there may not be time to develop a skill to the same remunerative
level as the specialist, he nevertheless compensates by being able to earn some
income in several areas while needing less money in other areas, because he's
able to do some work himself and to shop for lower prices. 

虽然可能没有时间，将技能发展到与专家相同的水平，但他能够通过在几个领域，赚取一些收入，而在其他领域花更少的钱来弥补，因为他能够自己做一些工作，并以更低的价格购人产品。

This is a person who
is less dependent on the market system than the specialist. It's a person for whom
net worth is less relevant. In extreme cases, money may even be irrelevant.

这是一个比专家更不依赖市场体系的人。这是一个与净值无关的人。在极端情况下，金钱甚至可能无关紧要。

This figure shows the degree of skills for a Renaissance man. 

该图显示了文艺复兴人的技能程度。

Notice
how he pays very little for most activities. Also notice how he's able to
derive money from several activities.

请注意，他为大多数活动支付的费用很少。还要注意他是如何从多项活动中赚钱的。

It is curious that experts recommend that investments be broadly diversified,
while  at  the  same  time  recommending  that  job  skills  should  be  highly
concentrated. 

奇怪的是，专家建议投资广泛多元化，同时建议工作技能应该高度集中。

The Renaissance man has a lot of diversified human capital, but it
will  be  difficult,  though  not  impossible,  to  sell  it  on  a  market  tailored  for
specialists. 

文艺复兴人拥有大量多样化的人力资本，，尽管有不可能，但在专为专家量身定制的市场上，出售它是困难的。

Selling isn't the point, though. Rather than focusing on how to sell,
it's often more efficient to focus on how not to buy! And a wide assortment of
skills can substitute for a lot of otherwise required income.

不过，销售不是重点。 而不是专注于如何销售，专注于如何不购买往往更有效率！各种各样的技能可以替代收入的需要。

According to experts on expertise (yes, there is such as thing!), it takes 1,000
hours of focused effort to be considered competent in a subject, 3,000 hours to
master  it,  and  10,000  hours  to  become  an  expert  (see  Gauging  mastery).29

根据成为专家的专家的说法（是的，有这样的事情！），需要1千小时的专注努力才能胜任一门学科，需要3千小时才能掌握它，而要成为专家则需要1万小时（请参阅[测量掌握程度]()）。

Considering that the average person spends four hours a day or almost 1,500
hours  a  year  watching  TV  or  playing  computer  games,  it  is  not  an
insurmountable task over a period of years to become an expert in a field while
simultaneously  becoming  competent  in  several  other  fields,  perhaps  even
mastering one of them.

考虑到普通人每天花费4小时，或每年将近1500小时看电视或玩电脑游戏，成为某一领域的专家并同时在其他几个领域胜任，这并不是一项在几年内无法完成的任务， 甚至可能完全掌握其中一个领域。

Which skills should one focus on? The Renaissance men of the 17th century
strove to increase their ability to
defend themselves with a variety of weapons.
play a variety of musical instruments and paint.
debate politics and philosophy.
advance knowledge and the sciences.
be an accomplished author and poet

应该关注哪些技能？17世纪的文艺复兴时期的人们，努力提高他们这些能力：

- 用各种武器保护自己。

- 演奏各种乐器和画画。

- 辩论政治和哲学。

- 先进的知识和科学。

- 成为一个有成就的作家和诗人。


For  our  modern  purposes,  the  fields  can  perhaps  be  grouped  into  seven
generic  fields--physiological,  economical,  intellectual,  emotional,  social,
technical, and ecological. 

就我们现代的目的而言，这些领域或许可以分为七个通用领域——生理、经济、智力、情感、社会、技术和生态。

Initially, it may seem overwhelming to master such a
wide  array  of  subjects,  and  perhaps  the  idea  is  even  incompatible  with  your
personal preferences. 

一开始，掌握如此广泛的学科似乎让人不知所措，而且这个想法甚至可能与你的个人喜好格格不入。

However, the universal ideal doesn't require total mastery
of a subject; it only aspires to it. Keep in mind that effort and results are not
linearly  related  over  the  entire  range  (see  Sigmoids,  logistic  curves,  and  the
maximum  power  principle  and  this  figure).  

然而，普遍的想法并不需要完全掌握一门学科，只是立志于追求它。请记住，工作量和结果在整个范围内并不是线性的（请参阅[S型曲线逻辑曲线和最大能量原则]()以及此[图]()）。

Ideally,  effort  should  be  spread
equally between all subjects, though due to personal preferences and talents a
person may decide to focus more on some areas than others.

理想情况下，努力应该在所有科目之间平均分配，但由于个人喜好和才能，一个人可能会决定更多地关注某些领域而不是其他领域。

Unlike  businesses,  consumers  rarely  use  debt  to  invest  and  generate  an income.

Instead, they use debt to purchase consumables like vehicles, houses, furniture, and electronics, which don't generate income.

In this case, interest is no longer the cost of doing business.

It's now the cost of living beyond one's means.

This cost ranges from typical mortgage rates to typical credit card rates multiplied by the outstanding debt.

Over the lifetime of a consumer this adds up to substantial amounts of money.

Consider a typical six percent mortgage that runs 30 years.

Here the total interest over the years is ~105% on top of the cost of the home.

For those who are just starting their repayment, interest and finance charges  comprise  almost  all  of  the  monthly  payment--home  equity  is  mainly  built towards the end of the repayment.

It's very hard to become wealthy and financially independent this way, and predominantly making interest payments is more accurately thought of as paying rent while being responsible for all the expenses associated with home ownership.


All debt comes with a contractual obligation of repayment, which is usually structured  to  last  30  years  to  minimize  individual  monthly  payments,  but definitely not to minimize the total number of payments, which is maximized by increasing  the  maturity  of  the  loan  as  much  as  possible.

If  the  maturity  is extended in perpetuity, the interest payments become similar to rent.

If the only means of repayment is a job, this means that working must also last at least 30 years.

This way, a single decision just after leaving school turns into a lifelong commitment that can be very hard to escape, given that the borrowed money has been spent on increasing consumption rather than increasing production.


Most major consumption is financed.

This means that money spent on major consumption  has  not  been  earned  by  those  who  spend  it.

This  has  a  drastic consequence for the way the market sets the price level of anything that can be financed,16 and today, anything--even a fast food meal at a burger franchise--can be  financed  through  unsecured  credit.

Specifically,  things  are  priced  not according  to  how  much  money  people  have  saved,  but  how  large  a  monthly payment borrowers and lenders think can be made in the future.

This is set by the interest rate, which is partially manipulated by the government, and credit ratings, which are partially manipulated by individual consumers, lenders, and credit rating agencies.

These facts change the way people think of money.

What you have saved becomes less important than what you can potentially borrow.


The consequence is that the cost in terms of hours worked is no longer fully appreciated, and people work and spend more--sometimes far more--than they would if they paid cash, counting on being able to pay it back in the future or rolling over the debt, thus being forever locked in.

Many even spend so much that they can't pay it back, leading to misallocated resources which could have been spent more fairly by those who earned the money.


The systemic consequence of this waste is that prices in a debt-driven society are higher than they would be in a cash-driven society, simply because more money (credit) is chasing the goods.

This leads to bubbles and crashes due to credit being either too cheap or too expensive, and a psychological lag leading to a  bipolar  economy  of  alternating  optimism and pessimism.

17  It  would  appear that economists, or the effective majority of individuals who engage in lending and  borrowing,  haven't  yet  been  able  to  perfectly  model  future  demand  and supply, and thus an economy that is built on predictions of future demand and  supply  (by  the  pricing  of  future  payments  in  the  form  of  the  interest  rate)  is inherently unstable.


Ideally, personal finance shifts cash flows around in time so that money is available when it's most wanted and paid back when it's least wanted.

However, this shifting comes at a price in terms of fees and interest charges.

In particular, many people who don't know any better will simply make the standard choice, which  effectively  involves  contractual  obligations  to  work  all  of  their  life  in exchange for houses, vehicles, furniture, electronics, and other stuff.

To wit, a salary or even the potential of a future salary seems to be a gateway to the debt drug;  so  many  people  could  probably  reduce  the  risk  of  getting  into  debt  by simply quitting their jobs.

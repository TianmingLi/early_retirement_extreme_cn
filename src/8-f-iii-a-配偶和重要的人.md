When  writing  and  talking  about  this  lifestyle,  the  most  common  lament  I hear is that, "This would be a lot easier if I was single." 
在写作和谈论这种生活方式时，我听到的最常见的哀叹是，“如果我是单身，这会容易得多。”
Technically, this is not true:  Due  to  economy  of  scale,  two  or  more  people  working  together  towards homeotelic  goals  will  always  be  better  off  than  two  people  working  separately (see Contingency goal-setting).
从技术上讲，这是不正确的：由于规模经济，两个或两个以上的人一起努力实现顺势调节目标，总比两个人单独工作要好（见[应变目标设定]()）。

Today,  society  has  reached  a  level  of  wealth  that  has  made  the  economic benefit of living in a community or a tribe, and, to some extent, even a family, unnecessary.
今天，社会已经达到了相当高的财富水平，使得生活在一个社区或部落，甚至在某种程度上生活在一个家庭中的经济利益变得不必要。
This  is  partly  why  there's  a  growing  number  of  singles;  the economic  inefficiency  of,  for  example,  two  people  having  twice  as  many refrigerators  than  a  couple,  has  become  affordable.
这就是为什么有越来越多的单身人士；例如，两个人的冰箱数量是一对夫妇的两倍，这种经济效率低下的现象已经变得可以承受。
The  main  problem  is therefore social.
因此，主要问题是社会问题。
In fact, some people have told me outright that they could never live in a space as small as we do (currently two people in 289sqft) because they can't  stand  being  in  the  same  room  as  the  person  they  married  for  extended periods of time, or they can't deal with the idea of their children playing in the same room they're in.
事实上，有些人直截了当地告诉我，他们永远不可能住在像我们这样小的空间里（目前有两个人住在27平方米的地方），因为他们无法忍受和他们结婚的人长时间呆在同一个房间里，或者他们无法处理孩子在同一个房间里玩耍。
I'm not making this up.
这不是我编造的。
Material wealth has made it easy to avoid having to develop any social skills or flexibility.
物质财富使得人们很容易避免发展任何社交技能或灵活性。

I  think  it's  rare  to  find  two  people  who  agree  on  everything,  and  who  stay that way; at least that is what divorce statistics suggest.
我认为很难找到两个人在所有事情上都意见一致，并且一直如此；至少离婚统计数据显示了这一点。
Fortunately, it's possible to reach a degree of compromise that allows one person to live this lifestyle and the  other  person  to  live  a  regular  consumer  lifestyle.
幸运的是，有可能达成某种程度的妥协，让一个人过上这种生活方式，另一个人过上正常的消费生活方式。
To  live  together,  a  couple has  to  agree  on  certain  things,  like  not  signing  up  for  debt,  and  how  much  to spend on common items like housing.
为了共同生活，一对夫妇必须在某些事情上达成一致，比如不签债务协议，以及在住房等共同项目上花费多少。
A compromise must be reached.
必须达成妥协。
For other things, whereas it would be nice to agree on them, like where to squeeze a tube of toothpaste, whether to have a TV or a car, it's not a crucial issue.
至于其他方面，尽管就这些问题达成一致会很好，比如挤牙膏的地方，是买电视还是买汽车，但这并不是一个关键问题。

Unless  you  possess  superior  persuasive  skills,  it's  no  use  arguing.
除非你有高超的说服能力，否则争吵是没有用的。
Most people  (and  especially  children)  will  follow  your  example  rather  than  your suggestions,  if  they  follow  at  all.
大多数人（尤其是孩子）会以你为榜样，而不是你的建议，如果他们真的想遵循的话。
Children will  follow  practically  any  example (and believe anything you tell them, so be careful there), but adults are calcified already and usually want to follow their own example rather than yours, unless it becomes clear that your way is better.
孩子们几乎会效仿任何榜样（并且相信你告诉他们的任何事情，所以在这里要小心），但成年人已经习惯了，他们通常想效仿自己的榜样，而不是你的榜样，除非你的方式变得更好。
This means you have to demonstrate that there  is  a  viable,  credible  alternative.
这意味着你必须证明有一个可行的、可信的替代方案。
Once  your  spouse,  or  any  other  person you're  trying  to  convince,  is  ready,  he/she  will  generally  come  around  very quickly.
一旦你的配偶或任何其他你试图说服的人准备好了，他/她通常会很快跟过来。
For instance, you may build up a savings account or what people with bills, job-dependence and other liabilities call an emergency fund.
例如，你可以建立一个储蓄账户，或者依赖工作的人所说的紧急基金。
It is very rare for someone not to see the sense in that.
很少有人不明白其中的意义。
If your spouse is already familiar with the concept, start talking about how your "emergency fund" will support you for five years, say, and that you're thinking about switching careers or taking a long hiatus.
如果你的配偶已经熟悉这个概念，那就开始谈论你的“应急基金”将如何为你提供五年的支持，比如说，你正在考虑转行或长期休假。
A  five  year  fund  is  in  another  category  altogether.
五年期基金完全属于另一类。
It  is  qualitatively different,  because  it  gives  you  many  more  opportunities  in  comparison  to  the mere breathing room a traditional emergency fund provides.
这在本质上是不同的，因为与传统应急基金提供的仅仅是喘息空间相比，它给了你更多的机会。
A normal six month fund  is  only  designed  to  pay  your  bills  while  you  go  and  look  for  another  job because  you  just  got  fired,  or  carry  you  over  while  on  an  extended  sick-leave.
一个六个月基金只能用于支付你的账单，当你刚刚被解雇，要去寻找另一份工作，或带你度过长期的病假。
Those who focus solely on these problems will have a hard time wrapping their heads around the larger timeframe and additional possibilities.
那些只关注这些问题的人，将很难看到更大的时间框架和更多的可能性。。
However, if your spouse's emergency fund is only the standard six months, but she is beginning to think that her current life path sucks, she'll most likely start saving more so that she'll have the same options.
然而，如果你配偶的应急基金只有六个月，但她开始认为她目前的生活道路很糟糕，她很可能会开始存更多钱，这样她就有了同样的选择。
If your accounts are joint, say you would prefer to save the money whenever she proposes an additional expense.
如果你的账户是联名账户，那么当她提出更多钱时，你更愿意存钱。
Suggest that you split some money into his and hers, and if he wants to buy something, fine, but you reserve the same amount of money for savings.
建议你把一些钱分成他的和她的两部分，如果他想买东西，可以，但你保留同样数额的钱用于储蓄。
After a while, you can start talking about the interest you're earning.
一段时间后，你可以开始谈论你正在赚取的利息。
One thing that tends to get people going is  when  I  talk  about  how  the  money  my  savings  generates  on  average corresponds  to  a  full-time  minimum  wage  job,  and  how  that  essentially  means that the person is working for me.
有一件事往往会让人们去做，那就是，当我谈到我的储蓄产生的钱如何与全职最低工资不相上下，以及这从本质上意味着有人为我工作的时候。
That seems to get people thinking--yes? 
这似乎让人们思考——是吗？

If you want your spouse to adopt some change, another thing to try is to find something  they  are  familiar  with.
如果你想让你的配偶接受一些改变，另一件事是尝试找到他们熟悉的东西。
For  instance,  my  wife  couldn't  see  herself living  in  a  tiny  house  less  than  150sqft  (my  original  plan),  so  I  started  talking about boats.
例如，我妻子不想住在不到14平方米（我最初的计划）的小房子里，所以我开始谈论船。
Then a reader of my blog suggested living in a motorhome.
然后我博客的一位读者建议住在房车里。
Unlike me,  my  wife  had  actually  been  in  an  motorhome  and  lived  in  a  mobile  home park at some point, so she was familiar with those and was much less resistant to this idea.
与我不同的是，我的妻子住过房车，并在某个时候住在一个移动家庭公园里，所以她对这些都很熟悉，对这个想法也不那么抗拒。
Had she not been, I guess one way would have been to start camping and  make  the  trips  longer  and  longer,  after  which  I'd  combine  this  with  the suggestion that if we started camping full-time, we could cut our budget in half.
如果她没有过这种经历，我想一种方法就是开始露营，并让旅行时间越来越长，之后我会结合这个建议，如果我们开始全职露营，我们可以将预算削减一半。
Often, it is merely a question of exploring all alternatives.
通常，这只是一个探索所有替代方案的问题。
You just never know.
你永远不知道。

Try acquiring a majority of your stuff through swapping or freecycling.
试着通过交换或循环来获取大部分物品。
This might  make  your  spouse  reconsider  the  idea  of  paying  for  things,  especially when he/she sees the envelopes arriving by mail or when you come home with a leather jacket, proudly announcing that you didn't pay for it or that someone else is  now  using  those  rollerskates  that  took  up  space  in  the  closet.
这可能会让你的配偶重新考虑花钱买东西的想法，尤其是当他/她看到收到快递，或者当你带着皮夹克回家，并自豪地宣布你没有花钱，或者其他人正在使用那些占据壁橱空间的旱冰鞋。
Get  furniture used  and  make  this  your  norm.
使用家具，让它成为你的常态。
Mention  that  this  month  your  expenses  were completely  covered  by  income  from  your  investment  accounts.
提到这个月你的开支完全由你投资账户的收入支付。
Volunteer  for housework.
自愿做家务。
The golden rule of volunteering is that the volunteer gets to do it his way.
志愿工作的黄金法则是志愿者按照自己的方式去做。
If  you  want  to  eat  better  for  less,  volunteer  to  cook.
如果你想吃得更好，吃得更少，自己去做。
If  you  want  to  save money  on  cleaning  supplies,  start  making  them  yourself.
如果你想在清洁用品上省钱，那就自己动手做吧。
This  takes  leadership abilities, but if not you, then who? 
这需要领导能力，但如果不是你，那是谁呢？

None  of  this  guarantees  success,  but  maybe,  just  maybe  someday  your spouse will have a problem that is best solved using one of your solutions, and you'll be right there.
所有这些都不能保证成功，但有可能，只是也许有一天你的配偶会有一个问题，最好用你的解决方案来解决，而你就在那里。
